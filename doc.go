// Module testify is a set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.
//
// Testify contains the following packages:
//
// The [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert] package provides a comprehensive set of assertion functions that tie in to [the Go testing system].
// The [github.com/stretchr/testify/require] package provides the same assertions but as fatal checks.
//
// A [golangci-lint] compatible linter for testify is available called [testifylint].
//
// [the Go testing system]: https://go.dev/doc/code#Testing
// [golangci-lint]: https://golangci-lint.run/
// [testifylint]: https://github.com/Antonboom/testifylint
