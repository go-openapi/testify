**The v2 our tests wanted**

The [`testify/v2`][testifyv2] package has a fairly large API surface.

This is in part inherited from the original [`testify`][testifyv1] and also
largely due to the many available variants of the same assertion function.

The following sections organize the assertion API into usage domains,
with all documented exported variants documented in a more concise form than the
[reference godoc documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-openapi/testify/v2).

## Domains

The `testify` API is organized in 19 logical domains shown below.
Each domain contains assertions regrouped by their use case (e.g. http, json, error).
